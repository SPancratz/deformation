mat_dense
=========

* Eventually, once there is a module for generic dense vectors, 
  re-write some parts of the code to use these

* Consider renaming the entire module to "mat" instead of "mat_dense"

generics.h
==========

* Rename "mat_ctx_t" throughout the whole project

mat_csr
=======

* Implement sparse system solving using block triangularisation and 
  LUP decomposition on the (dense) kernels
