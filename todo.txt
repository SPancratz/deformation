mat_dense
=========

* Eventually, once there is a module for generic dense vectors, 
  re-write some parts of the code to use these

generics.h
==========

* Rename "mat_ctx_t" throughout the whole project

perm
====

* This is only a temporary place for the permutation generation 
  function.  Eventually, it needs to be moved somewhere more sensible

* There's now a module "perm".  These functions still need to be 
  used in the various places, though

* There is also one function remaining in "perm.h", namely for the 
  printing of long vectors, that needs to be moved or removed

mat_csr
=======

* Implement sparse system solving using block triangularisation and 
  LUP decomposition on the (dense) kernels

* Change mat_csr_block_triangularise to include a value at 
  B[nb] == m

mon
===

* Add randtest functions
