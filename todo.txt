mat_dense
=========

* Write test code for "mul_vec"
* Use the test code for "mul_vec" to write test code for "lup_solve"
* Commit

* Eventually, once there is a module for generic dense vectors, 
  re-write some parts of the test code to use these 
  (e.g. t-mul_vec, t-lup_solve)

mat_csr
=======

* Implement sparse system solving using block triangularisation and 
  LUP decomposition on the (dense) kernels
