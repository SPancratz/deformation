mat_dense
=========

* Eventually, once there is a module for generic dense vectors, 
  re-write some parts of the code to use these

generics.h
==========

* Rename "mat_ctx_t" throughout the whole project

perm.h
======

* This is only a temporary place for the permutation generation 
  function.  Eventually, it needs to be moved somewhere more sensible.

mat_csr
=======

* Implement sparse system solving using block triangularisation and 
  LUP decomposition on the (dense) kernels
